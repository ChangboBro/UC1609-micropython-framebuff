# UC1609-micropython-framebuff
A simple micropython lib (class) to drive UC1609 192*64 dot matrix LCD display, using framebuffer (a MicroPython-specific librarie)

the main.py is an example to show you how to initialize the class and how to call its method.

the UC1609.py is the lib file you can use in your own project.

I just tested it with my RaspberryPi Pico, didn't test with other MCU...

Hope it can help you.
